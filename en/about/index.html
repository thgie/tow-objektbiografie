            <h1><i>Times of Waste</i></h1>

            <p>Waste is material that is perceived differently depending on the context. Whether it is a promising resource or the unavoidable leftover: what becomes waste cannot be disposed of without trace.</p>

            <p>The research project <i>Times of Waste</i> follows routes of (waste) materiality. In the field of e-waste, the interdisciplinary research team examines the transformation processes of a smartphone and its components as archetypical. It’s the quintessential everyday-life device, and leaves many kinds of waste – the greatest amount of which is produced not after but rather before use: in the mining processes of raw materials as Neodymium, and with people who work under deplorable conditions.</p>

            <p>With artistic-scientific research practices the team explores various waste materials and working contexts in landfills, repair shops or research laboratories.</p>

            <p>An object biography of the smartphone maps those various and often intricate transport routes and recycling movements. The geological and material afterlife of the field research – different granulates, slags or metals – bear witness to the fact that while humans scour the earth raw materials they eradicate not only the earth’s crust, but also fill it with new waste materials. Which leads to the questions: where does all the leftover go? And what can be done about it?</p>

            <p><i>Times of Waste</i> is about movement and is in movement. It is a work in progress and is a thinking of progressing. It is about progress of another kind, in which ecological, social and mental activities have equal place. The project incorporates different modes of collaboration – in the sense of ‘doing waste’ – within the team as well as with the project partners and protagonists in situ. The interest lies in modes and possibilities of the collaboration of science and art, in qualitative methods and transmedial techniques. And so it is an occasion to discuss the challenges that transdisciplinary work presents to all involved – this, too, is also work in progress.</p>

            <p>The aim of the project is to break-up cultural connotations of waste as well as to influence the discussion about sustainable ways to deal with raw material. It does so by applying an artistic-scientific, process-oriented approach and its aesthetic implications as well as by exchange and discussion in public events such as the exhibition <i>Times of Waste</i> – The Leftover, the audio walk wastescapes, the panel discussion Green Crimes and several project workshops.</p>

            <h4>Research team <i>Times of Waste</i></h4>
            <p>The interdisciplinary research team consists of six people ranging from visual anthropology, art theory & practices, sound design to environmental studies, programming, interface & graphic design: Flavia Caviezel (lead), Mirjam Bürgin, Anselm Caminada, Adrian Demleitner, Marion Mertens, Yvonne Volkart and Sonia Malpeso. Most of the team members have been collaborating since RhyCycling. Aesthetics of Sustainability in the Basel Border Area (2010- 2013); <i>Times of Waste</i> runs from 1/2015–3/2018 and is financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation and project partners. Both projects are situated at the Institute of Experimental Design and Media Cultures/Critical Media Lab at the Academy of Art and Design of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland.</p>

            <p>Details about the research team, activities and outcomes are accessible on <a href="http://www.times-of-waste.ch">www.times-of-waste.ch</a>.</p>
